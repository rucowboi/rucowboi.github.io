                    The <span class="stateName">[REPLACE STATE/REGISTRY]</span> Cancer Maps project aims to provide data
                    for geographies beyond county-level statistics to better serve cancer control, public health, and

                    <span class="stateName">[REPLACE STATE/REGISTRY]</span> Cancer Maps allows users to interactively

                    called zones, which are aggregates of census tracts. We have used a data-driven approach to define
                    <span class="numZones">[REPLACE NUM_ZONES]</span> zones for <span class="stateName">[REPLACE

                    county, but larger than census tract. Zones vary in population size from <span

                    On this website, data are shown by cancer reporting zone. These zones have been designed so that they have a minimum population, have similar demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, and are geographically compact (they minimize the distance between different parts of the zone). The minimum population for each zone is 50,000 people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Counties with larger populations (more than 100,000 people) were divided into multiple Zones by combining adjacent census tracts. Three demographic and socioeconomic characteristics were used to determine similarity: the percent of the population who are not non-Hispanic White, percent of the population with incomes below poverty, and the proportion of the population living in urban and rural areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Newark is treated as if it were a county. The census tracts within Newark are partitioned into 5 Zones. The remainder of Essex County is partitioned without consideration of Newark.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For counties Cape May and Salem, which have between 50,000 and 100,000 people, the county is the Zone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used population data from Census 2010 and Census 2010 tract geographies to construct the zones.
                    Poverty data came from the American Community Survey 2012-2016 5-year data. We used a software zone
                    design program called <a href="https://www.geodata.soton.ac.uk/software/AZTool/"
                        target="_blank">AZTool</a> to identify aggregations of adjacent tracts and counties that
                    optimize the three objectives: a target population of 50,000, geographic compactness, and similarity
                    in terms of minority population, poverty, and urbanicity characteristics
                </p>
                <p class="title">Zone Names</p>
                <p>
                    CTAZ names are given by the largest municipality in the Zone by population followed by the County name and number of the Zone within the County. Should a municipality straddle one or more CTAZs, then the population of the municipality was portioned by the area within each CTAZ. For a hypothetical example, if Springfield in Washington county had a population of 100,000 and 60% was in Zone A and 40% in Zone B, then 60,000 Springfield residents were assigned to Zone A (the 3rd CTAZ in Washington County) and 40,000 residents to Zone B. If 60,000 was the largest municipality by population in Zone A then Zone A would be named Springfield – Washington 3.

                        <p>The New Jersey State Cancer Registry (NJSCR) is a population-based registry and includes all cancer cases diagnosed in New Jersey residents since October 1, 1978. The NJSCR serves the entire State of New Jersey, which includes a population of approximately 9.3 million people.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the NJSCR is to track cancer in New Jersey supporting efforts to promote the following activities: scientific research; public and professional education programs; and planning and implementation of cancer control and prevention activities. The NJSCR strives to improve the quality and enhance the usefulness of its data. </p>
                        <p>The NJSCR was established by legislation (NJSA 26:2-104 et. seq.) in 1977 in response to concern that New Jersey was suffering from the highest cancer incidence and mortality rates in the country. New Jersey regulations require the reporting of all newly diagnosed cancer cases to the NJSCR within six months of diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>The NJSCR participates in the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR). The NJSCR is also a member of the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR). The NJSCR is also a member of the International Association of Cancer Registries (IACR).</p>
                        <p>The New Jersey State Cancer Registry (NJSCR), under the direction of the State Department of Health in partnership with Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, was awarded a seven-year contract from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in 2021 to support core infrastructure and research activities as part of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. The SEER Program is considered the most authoritative source of information on cancer incidence and survival in the United States, collecting data accounting for the diverse demographics covering approximately 48% of the US population. The NJSCR is one of 28 population-based CORE registries as well as 10 SEER Research Support registries in the country that are part of the SEER Program. </p>
                        <p>The NJSCR has been awarded the NAACCR Gold Standard, the highest standard possible.</p>

                        <p><strong>Census Tracts</strong> are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county with between 1,200 and 8,000 people and an optimum size of 4,000 people. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of statistical data. However, in order to protect citizen confidentiality, the NJSCR does not release data to the general public at the Census Tract-level. By combining data over longer periods of time or wider areas, larger numbers of cases are included, reducing the threat of identification of individual cases. Additionally, larger numbers of cases results in more stable estimates of cancer incidence.</p>
                        <p>Here we combine Census Tracts to form Census Tract Aggregation Zones based on adjacency and similarity in population sociodemographic characteristics: poverty, rurality, and racial/ethnic minority (i.e., non-White) composition. Zones are required to have a minimum population of 50,000. There are 150 Zones in New Jersey which vary in population size from 50,676 to 97,265 and are composed of between 11 and 32 Census Tracts. Zones are generally smaller than a county and larger than a census tract to help provide additional options for understanding disease burden and better facilitate public health and policy planning.</p>

                        <p>Age-adjusted incidence rates for all invasive cancers, including specific in situ bladder cancers, are calculated using SEER*Stat.

            <b>Age-Adjusted Incidence Rate (AAIR):</b> Age-adjustment is a statistical method that allows comparisons of
            incidence rates to be made between populations with different age distributions. This is important since the
            incidence of most cancers increases with age. An age-adjusted cancer incidence (or death) rate is defined as
            the number of new cancers (or deaths) per 100,000 population that would occur in a certain period of time if
            that population had a ‘standard’ age distribution. In the <span class="stateName">[REPLACE
